\section*{Risley Charter}
\section{Name}
\label{sec:name}
The name of this organization shall be Risley Residential College for the Creative and Performing Arts. \textsc{\footnotesize{(Spring 1987)}}
\section{Purpose}
The purpose of Risley Residential College is to promote the creative and performing arts in the Cornell and Ithaca communities.
\section{Membership and Fees}
\begin{enumerate}[A.]
\item There will be two categories of Risley membership: "In-House" and "Out-Of-House." Risley membership will be by application only and will be open to any interested person. Risley members may be residents (in-house) or non-residents (out-of-house). In-house Risley members must be full-time, registered students at Cornell University, and must also apply for residency. \textsc{\footnotesize{(rev. Fall 2002, Spring 2010)}}
\item All Risley members must pay an activity fee. The amount of the activity fee shall be approved by referendum among the membership. The results of such referendum must be approved by the parent organization specified by the By- Laws and can take effect no sooner than the beginning of the academic year following its proposal. \textsc{\footnotesize{(rev. Spring 2002)}}
\item Any Cornell-affiliated person who so wishes may, after successful application to Risley, pay the Risley activity fee and become an out-of-house member. Out-ofhouse members will have full access to the Risley shops on the same basis as inhouse Risley members. Fees collected from Risley out-of-house members will be applied to the general fund for programs and maintenance. This fund will be administered by the Risley Kommittee. Out-of-house Risley members retain full membership rights. \textsc{\footnotesize{(rev. Spring 1996, Spring 2010)}}
\end{enumerate}
\section{The Risley Shops}
\begin{enumerate}[A.]

\item Kommittee shall have jurisdiction over all specific requests for spacetime and money, but shall act in accordance with spaaaaaace use and budget policies developed by Risley members.

At the beginning of each meeting, the names of all Kommittee members who have been given leave to miss the meeting shall be announced and recorded in the minutes. (Spring 1986, rev. Spring 2010, rev. Spring 2011, rev. Spring 2012)

A quorum shall be defined as a number of Kommittee members exceeding one-half the total number of elected and appointed Kommittee members (not to include members by endurance). (rev. Fall 2002, rev. Spring 2006)

\item Impeachment. At any time, any member of Kommittee may call for a Vote of No Confidence as specified in the Parliamentary Rules. (Fall 2003)

\section{Rules Governing Kommittee Actions}
\begin{enumerate}[A.]
\item Rules for Kommittee meetings shall be decided by the Risley membership. The chair of the Risley Kommittee shall preside over any Kommittee meeting. If, for a single meeting, no Chair is available, then the Chair shall appoint a replacement from the elected members to preside over the meeting. (rev. Fall 2002, rev. Fall 2006, rev. Spring 2010)
\item \textbf{Regular Meetings.} Regular Kommittee meetings shall be held every Sunday followed by a Monday on which classes are scheduled during the academic year at 9:00 p.m.. This time may be changed by a majority vote of the full Kommittee membership. (rev. Fall 2007)

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Special Kommittee meetings shall be called by the Chair, the RAs, or the RHD. The agenda for such meetings shall be finalized and posted by the caller before the meeting. Absences from special Kommittee meetings may, in mitigating circumstances, be granted by the Chair with no impact on a member's attendance record.
\item Special general meetings may be called by the RHD, an RA, or Kommittee.
\item Emergency meetings: The quorum may not be lowered for any emergency meetings. An adequate attempt must be made to inform all Kommittee members about emergency meetings. Absence from an emergency Kommittee meeting will not affect a member's attendance record.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\section{Subcommittees}
\begin{enumerate}[A.]
\item Kommittee may authorize new subcommittees to accomplish specific tasks (ex. Staff Selection subcommittee) or activate dormant subcommittees to accomplish recurring tasks (ex.

\end{enumerate}
\section{Elections and Transitions}
\begin{enumerate}[A.]
\item Elections for Risley Kommittee positions shall be held once each semester. All elected members from the previous semester ("Lame Ducks") continue until the next election. Further regulations governing Kommittee elections will be found in the By-Laws.
\item Multi-Headed Hydra Rule. All Kommittee positions (except those of Members-at-Large, staff, and the position of Chair) may be held jointly by a team of people provided that those people ran as a team for the position. Each member of such team has their own vote at Kommittee, and each member shall be counted separately in establishing a quorum. Should one of them be decapitated by the demi-god Hercules, they shall be replaced by two new candidates. \footnote{Blame Christian Brickhouse (Spring 2015) for this.} Chair may only be held by at most two people. (rev. Spring 1989, moved Fall 2002, rev Spring 2015)
\item Dates and procedures for the elections of all elected members shall be found in the By-Laws. If no alternate wishes to hold the office, then any Member-By- Endurance may be appointed by a 2/3 vote, provided that person wishes to hold the position. (rev., moved Fall 2002)
\item The New Blood Rule. The fall semester membership of Kommittee (excluding Members-By-Endurance) shall contain at least two New-to-Risley ("new bloods"). If no two new bloods receive enough votes to be elected in their own right, the Member-at-Large seats shall all be filled as follows:
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item If only one new blood receives enough votes to be elected, the other new blood Member-at-Large candidate with the most votes shall be elected as Member-at-Large.
\item If no new bloods receive enough votes to be elected, the two new blood Member-at-Large candidates with the most votes shall be elected as Member-at-Large.
\item The remaining six seats shall be filled by the other candidates with the greatest number of votes.
\end{enumerate}
\item (rev., moved Fall 2002, rev. Fall 2003, rev. Fall 2007)
\item If, at the end of the semester, any elected Kommittee member knows they will not be able to continue their duties as lame duck at the beginning of the coming semester (e.g. due to graduation, study abroad, or general abandonment of Risley), their position shall be included in the Special Election at the end of the semester. The newly elected person shall carry out the rest of their predecessorâ s term, and the position shall be open again for the next election. In the event that a position is left vacant unexpectedly, and must be filled immediately, the GV shall appoint an interim until a Special Election can be held. If a portion of a muli-headed hydra leaves, the remaining head(s), provided at least one exists, may carry out their duties without an additional election. (Spring 2010, rev. Spring 2011, rev. Spring 2015)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Amendments to the Charter}
\begin{enumerate}[A.]
\item Amendments to the Charter shall be passed in accordance with the provisions established in section XV. By-Laws.
\item Amendments to Charter may be made at any time, but there will be a meeting of Kommittee designated, once a year, to deal with amendments to Charter. This meeting will be called Charter Review.
\item If a proposed amendment to Charter is deemed controversial, and it goes to referendum, there must be at least two choices, even if one of them is simply a reiteration of the current policy.(Spring 2011)
\item All potential amendments to Charter must be presented in writing to Kommittee prior to voting.  This does not apply to those sent to referendum, for which written options must be presented to the whole of Risley, as per XII. C. (Fall 2014)
\end{enumerate}
\section{By-Laws}
\begin{enumerate}[A.]
\item By-Laws will be placed into four categories:
\begin{enumerate}[1.]

\item General Policies may be created, amended, or deleted by a 2/3 vote. Any General Policy may become a Restricted Policy through referendum.
\item Policies governing Risley's relationship with specific outside groups ("OG Policies") are to be placed in the Outside Groups Appendix; these rules may be created, amended, or deleted by a majority vote.
\end{enumerate}
\item (rev. Fall 2006)
\item In the case of a conflict between elements to this document, policies are to be considered in the following order of precedence: Charter overrules all other elements; Restricted Policies overrule Parliamentary rules and General Policies; Parliamentary rules overrule General Policies.
\item A permanent record of the By-Laws in force shall be kept appended to the Charter and divided according to the proper classification, as outlined above. Each by-law adopted shall be appended along with the date of its adoption.
\item Furthermore, once each academic year, at a time to be determined as a Parliamentary Rule, the Charter and By-Laws shall be reviewed so as to keep the provisions and mechanisms of the Charter and By-Laws in the remembrance of all and to add or delete such provisions or rules as Kommittee or College sees fit.
\end{enumerate}
\section*{Parliamentary Rules}
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item \textbf{Robert's Rules.} Kommittee Meetings shall be conducted according to the 1915 edition of Robert's Rules of Order, unless otherwise listed in Charter. In the event that Robert's Rules and the Kommittee Charter contradict each other, Charter shall take precedence.  On a single occasion, Robert's Rules may be overridden by a simple majority.

Motions of a possibly controversial nature shall be made known before Kommittee meetings on the main bulletin board and otherwise advertised to the building. If a motion is not posted for 48 hours beforehand, the motion may be determined controversial by a simple majority vote of present members of Kommittee.

\begin{enumerate}[A.]
\item \textbf{Tabling a controversial motion.} A motion to table a controversial motion requires a simple majority to pass. During the time between tabling and the next Kommittee, the tabled motion must be advertised to the Risley community.

Those who abstained in the original vote now must vote for or against the motion. No abstentions are permitted during a division of the house. A division of the house may change the original outcome of the vote from passage to failure, or vice versa. (Fall 2002, rev. Fall 2006)

\item Any person present may motion for a Vote of No Confidence in any Kommittee member, but the motion must be seconded by a member of Kommittee. 
\item The person making the motion may make a statement as to why the member should be impeached and the member being impeached is entitled to a rebuttal.
\item No discussion of the Member being impeached may occur without that member present unless chronic absence from Kommittee is cited as reason for the impeachment.
\item The Chair, or acting Chair, may open or close the floor to further discussion at their option. Any person present may motion to call the question.

(rev. Spring 2015)
\item \textbf{Deallocations.} Motions to revoke an allocation (deallocate) require the same margin to pass as the original motion. (Fall 2007)
\item A majority of Kommittee members present may overrule a decision of the Chair. (moved Spring 2015)

\begin{enumerate}[a.]
\item Risley Kommittee may make exceptions to the Outside Groups policy with a 2/3 vote.

\begin{enumerate}[a.]
\item A 2/3 vote shall be required to allocate the Great Hall (Dining Hall) for the use of groups from outside of Risley.

\end{enumerate}
\item Sponsorship 
\begin{enumerate}[a.]

Following the speeches, there shall be a debate between the candidates in which anyone present at Kommittee may ask any question of the candidates, and the candidates shall be able to respond.

\item Votes are tallied by summing the number of ones for each candidate or options; 
\item If a candidate or options obtains a majority of ones and has more votes than any other candidate, that candidate wins; 
\item If no candidate has a majority, the candidate or option with the fewest ones is removed, and all rankings on a ballot below that candidate are advanced one rank; 
\item This process is be repeated until one candidate or option has a majority and the greatest number of votes; that candidate wins;

\item In the event of a tie between two candidates, the candidate who had the most ones in the initial election shall win; if there is still a tie, a victor shall be selected by rock- paper-scissors, unless either candidate objects. In that case, there will be a re-vote. In the case of a re-vote, members may vote for either of the two candidates, regardless of for whom they voted previously. (Spring 2011)

\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\section*{Allocations and Groups}
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item \textbf{Fiscal Responsibility.} The following applies to all allocations of Kommittee funds: 
\begin{enumerate}[A.]
\item The person or group who asks for an allocation of Kommittee funds (the allocator) and the Grand Vizier are responsible for keeping track of how much money they have spent. (rev. Fall 2002) 
\item The allocator shall spend no more than the original allocation without an additional allocation from Kommittee. 
\item If more money is spent than was allocated, the allocator is personally responsible for these additional amounts. They may ask Kommittee to increase the allocation, but Kommittee is not obligated to do so. 
\item If Kommittee turns down a request to increase an allocation, the original allocator shall make payment of the additional amount to the Risley treasury. Until such payment is received in full, the original allocator shall neither be allowed to make additional space or money allocations, nor use any previous allocations. 
\item Any group that requests a cumulative sum of money greater than or equal to 2\% of Kommittee's total budget (as calculated only from the program fee for the semester) must give a detailed report of how they have used and plan to use their funds before receiving an allocation or obtaining a further allocation. (Fall 2004)
\item With the exception of major events (as defined in charter) and discretionary funds, all items for which funds were allocated at Kommittee must be submitted to the RHD within 7 days of the original request. After this deadline, the allocation becomes null and void, the funds are returned to Kommittee, and the original request must be resubmitted. (Spring 2015)
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Guidelines for the co-sponsorship of events originating outside Risley:}
\begin{enumerate}[A.]
\item Events cosponsored by Risley College should be largely oriented towards the creative or performing arts; 
\item They should allow as much participation of Risley residents, both in the planning and in the event itself, as possible; 
\item The Risley Kommittee should endeavor to encourage and participate in cosponsored events rather than make financial contributions; (rev. Fall 2002) 
\item Monetary co-funding should not be the only participation of Risley; events where no Risley members are likely to show up or participate should not be funded; 
\item Any events co-funded must be publicized within Risley so that residents know about the event; 
\item The Risley Kommittee should encourage allowing events to use space within Risley (to make it easier for Risley members to participate), but should not displace Risley activities. (Fall 1981)
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Music Room Prime Time.} The hours between 5 and 11 p.m. daily shall be defined as "prime time" in the Music Room.
\begin{enumerate}[A.]
\item No groups shall be allowed more than 2 hours of regularly scheduled prime time hours in the Music Room per week. 
\item Exceptions to this limit may be made by a 2/3 vote. (Spring 1984, rev. Fall 2002)
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{MaximumSpacetime Allocation.} In order to be more sensitive to the needs of Risley members, Kommittee shall not allocate more than 26 hours of combined spacetime in one semester to one person or group in a single motion or meeting. (rev. Fall 2002) For example, a group using the music room and the CLR a total of five hours per week would need to get separate Kommittee approval for every 5 weeks they need in the spaces. This would therefore not affect groups who only use their spaces 1.5 hours per week (or less). (Spring 1991, Rev. Spring 2015)
\item \textbf{AIR Welcoming Kommittee.} (Spring 2003, Deleted Spring 2012)
\item \textbf{RisOCs.} The Risley Kommittee shall, from time to time, establish its own orientation committee. This committee shall be called "the RisOCs", and shall assist new residents in moving in and stuff. There shall be a "Lord of the RisOCs", and he or she shall coordinate all RisOC activities. (Spring 2003)
\begin{enumerate}[A.]
\item RisOC applications--comprised of questions posed by the RHD--shall be made available exactly one month before study week. Applications shall be due two weeks later. The RHD shall select the RisOCS. (Fall 2004, rev. Spring 2012) 
\item The Lord of the RisOCs shall be nominated out of the RisOCs after the RisOCs have been accepted that Spring. The RisOCs shall vote on their Lord. The position may be held by a multi-headed hydra. If possible, the Lord (or at least one of the Lords) must have been a RisOC before. (Fall 2004, rev. Spring 2012) 
\item RisOCs shall be selected each spring for use the following fall. (Fall 2004)
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Implicit Kommittee allocation.} The CLR shall be implicitly allocated for all regular Kommittee meetings. (Fall 2007) 
\end{enumerate}
\section*{Use of Space}
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item \textbf{Clean Space Rule.} Space allocations shall be given with the stipulation that the space be kept clean; violations of this stipulation may result in the allocation being revoked.(Fall 1981)
\item \textbf{Murals}
\begin{enumerate}[A.] 
\item \textbf{Mural Approval Policy.} All murals painted in Risley must go through an approval process as follows:
\begin{enumerate}[a.]
\item All murals must be approved by a 2/3 vote of Kommittee.
\item The artist must contact the RHD to fulfill the parent organization's (specified in the By-Laws) requirements for murals. (rev. Spring 2012) 
\end{enumerate}
\item Approval should be sought by the artist before painting the mural, but approval may be received after a mural has been started. If an artist begins a mural before receiving approval, she must notify the RHD immediately to outline her intentions and designs, begin the hallway approval process within two days of starting the mural, and present the design at the next Kommittee meeting. Unfinished or unapproved murals are subject to paint-over responsibilities. (rev. Spring 2008) 
\item \textbf{Existing Murals}
\begin{enumerate}[a.]
\item There will be no additions to existing murals, except by the original artist, or with the consent of the original artist, who must follow the approval procedure stated in the Mural Approval Policy section, for these additions.
\item The only paint which will ever touch an existing mural is paint to refinish the mural, due to damage, age, etc. When refinishing a mural, the paint that is used must as closely as possible resemble the original paint colors.
\item To paint over an existing mural, you must get 30 signatures on a petition to send the issue to referendum. Kommittee may also call for referendum. There is no other way to eradicate a mural. 
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Mural Paint-over Responsibilities.} Unapproved murals and additions to existing murals may be removed at the expense of the artist. (rev. Fall 1990)
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Postering}
\begin{enumerate}[A.]
\item Posters may be placed on walls and doors (excluding the glass on exterior and fire doors) provided they are affixed in a manner that does not cause any damage and is in accordance with the parent organization's (specified in the By-Laws) policies. (rev. Fall 2002, rev. Fall 2007) 
\item Risley poster materials are, for the most part, to be used for advertising Risley programs only. Sole exceptions where materials might be used privately would include: posters to advertise resident-run spontaneous events, or to solicit or offer information on lost/found items. Uses excluded would be in particular those where materials are used to make political statements of any kind (unless, of course, Risley had officially taken a position on some political issue). 
\item Postering outside Risley. When Risley events are advertised outside Risley, Risley will follow postering guidelines set forth by the university. (Spring 1987)

\section*{Equipment}
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item \textbf{Risley Flag.} Risley Residential College will adopt an official flag for Risley. Risley Kommittee may opt, by a 2/3 vote, to call for possible flag designs from Risley members. Risley will then approve a design by referendum. Kommittee is responsible for the production and maintenance of any such flag. One physical copy of the flag should be properly displayed, under normal circumstances, somewhere in the common areas of Risley, and another physical copy should be stored by the archivist as a spare. The flag will be displayed at house meetings, and may be allocated for display at certain special events (ex. Slope Day) by a simple majority of Kommittee.
\item \textbf{Risley TV and VCR Policy}
\begin{enumerate}[A.] 
\item The TV room contains one TV maintained by the parent organization specified in the By-Laws. The Risley Kommittee, as an arbiter of TV Room disputes, states the following procedure for the settling of these disputes: "Majority rules, except in the case where a resident/residents is/are watching a program in progress (continuous programming, e.g. The Weather Channel, excluded). There will be a two hour limit for any single program, notwithstanding actual length if it would run longer. Politeness remains key." 
\item The TV Room may be allocated for special events.
\item Any DVDs, VCRs, Camcorders, or other TVs owned by Risley shall be used primarily for programming purposes. They may be allocated for programs by Kommittee. They shall also be available to residents for their own use. However, they may not be reserved for private functions. Risley staff shall oversee the use of this equipment. (Fall 1992)
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Piano Moving.} Pianos must be moved by a professional piano mover when the move involves the disassembly of the piano, up or down stairs, or outside the building. Any other moves can be performed by two or more people. For the purposes of this policy, the Kramer is not a piano. (Fall 1981, rev. Spring 1999)
\item \textbf{The Doughnut Machine Rule.} The Kramer piano shall be designated a non-piano and can be moved non-professionally with Kommittee approval. (Spring 1989)
\item \textbf{The Baby Machine Rule.} The photocopier adjacent to the Soda machines in the basement shall be designated a non-photocopier and a Baby Machine. (Fall 2002)
