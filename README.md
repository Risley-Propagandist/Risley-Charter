Risley members, Kommittee shall not allocate more than 26 hours of music room time in
one semester to one person or group in a single motion or meeting. (rev. Fall 2002) For
example, a group using the music room five hours per week would need to get separate

therefore not affect groups who only use the music room 1.5 hours per week (or less).
